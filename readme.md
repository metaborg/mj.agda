# MJ.agda

This development has been tested against Agda 2.5.3.
If you have this installed you should be able simply run `make` in the 
project root, which will checkout some libraries in `./lib/` first and
then build `./src/Readme.agda` which serves as the main entrypoint
to the development.

Alternatively you can run `make doc` to build the html version of the development
which is useful if you want to navigate the code (starting e.g. in `doc/Readme.html`)
without having an editor setup for it.
This will include syntax-highlighting and navigatable references.
